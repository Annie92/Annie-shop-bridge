COMPATIBILITY TEST FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPER

"ShopBridge" is an e-commerce application. As a part of this app, you need to build functionalities
that helps manage different items they would have for sale. This will require a frontend/backend
solution.

As a Frontend developer, you would be needing to provide a functional solution that can be used as
an user interface for this module.

Frontend Requirements:

• Pick a User Interface Framework that you are comfortable with or interviewing
for (Angular, AngularJS, ReactJs, React Native, ASP.NET MVC, Blazor, Any BOT Framework) to:
Create a functionality for the Product Admin, with components that can be used to perform the
below actions:

1. Add a new item to the inventory (The item should require a name, description, and price as
basic fields, think of additional information that would be useful along with considerations for
validations to ensure data sanity.)
2. Modify an item in the inventory.
3. Delete an item from the inventory.
4. Lists the items in the inventory.
• The data needs to be fetched via APIs from a backend application.
• All API calls should be asynchronous and not cause any full-page reloads.
• Consider usability in terms of navigations.
• Ensure Responsiveness
• Do include data validations as and when needed.
• Exception handlings need to be present.
Consider this to be just an elementary starting point to get you going and is much smaller compared
to the expanse of your knowledge!
Please feel free to demonstrate the width and creativity of your coding with the handling of
functionalities like business validations, image processing, stock manipulation, categories,
search, etc. along with technical pieces like exception handling, pagination...
Tracking:
Please do your best to keep track of how long you spend on the implementation of each of them, this
is for self-timing and to determine estimation accuracy.
1. Frontend functionality
2. Frontend presentational aspects (styling, DOM, etc)
3. Required Validations
4. Unit Test Coverage
